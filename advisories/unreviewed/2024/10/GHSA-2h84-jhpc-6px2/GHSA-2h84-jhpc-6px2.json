  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add NULL check for clk_mgr in dcn32_init_hw\n\nThis commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the\n`dcn32_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` is\nnull.\n\nThe fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` is not null before\naccessing its functions. This prevents a potential null pointer\ndereference.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn32/dcn32_hwseq.c:961 dcn32_init_hw() error: we previously assumed 'dc->clk_mgr' could be null (see line 782)",
