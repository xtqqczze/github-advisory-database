  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Sync efi page table's kernel mappings before switching\n\nThe EFI page table is initially created as a copy of the kernel page table.\nWith VMAP_STACK enabled, kernel stacks are allocated in the vmalloc area:\nif the stack is allocated in a new PGD (one that was not present at the\nmoment of the efi page table creation or not synced in a previous vmalloc\nfault), the kernel will take a trap when switching to the efi page table\nwhen the vmalloc kernel stack is accessed, resulting in a kernel panic.\n\nFix that by updating the efi kernel mappings before switching to the efi\npage table.",
