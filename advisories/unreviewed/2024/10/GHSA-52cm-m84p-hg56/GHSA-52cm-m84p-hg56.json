  "details": "The Poll Maker â€“ Versus Polls, Anonymous Polls, Image Polls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the order_by parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.6  due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
