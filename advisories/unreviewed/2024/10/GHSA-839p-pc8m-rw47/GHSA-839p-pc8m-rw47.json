  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()\n\nPatch series \"nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes\".\n\nThis series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that\ncan occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently\ndiscovered by syzbot.\n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nIf a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than\n2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of\nchild nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in\nnilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().\n\nThis is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,\nnilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of\npath[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level\nof the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),\nwhich accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.\n\nFix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which\nperforms sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to\ndetect this inconsistency.\n\nThanks to Lizhi Xu for trying to solve the bug and clarifying the cause\nearly on.",
