  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mdiobus: fix unbalanced node reference count\n\nI got the following report while doing device(mscc-miim) load test\nwith CONFIG_OF_UNITTEST and CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC enabled:\n\n  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,\n  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:\n  attach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@7107009c/ethernet-phy@0\n\nIf the 'fwnode' is not an acpi node, the refcount is get in\nfwnode_mdiobus_phy_device_register(), but it has never been\nput when the device is freed in the normal path. So call\nfwnode_handle_put() in phy_device_release() to avoid leak.\n\nIf it's an acpi node, it has never been get, but it's put\nin the error path, so call fwnode_handle_get() before\nphy_device_register() to keep get/put operation balanced.",
