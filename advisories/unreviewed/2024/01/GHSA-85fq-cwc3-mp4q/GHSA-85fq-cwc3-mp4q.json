It would\nbe possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node has\nbeen removed outside of the transaction.\n\nUnfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming that the\nquota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it.  This\nwill lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG\n(this is the default).",
