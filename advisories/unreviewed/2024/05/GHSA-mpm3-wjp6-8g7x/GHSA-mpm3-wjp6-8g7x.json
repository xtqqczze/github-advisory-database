  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling\n\nSyzbot reports that when you have AP_VLAN interfaces that are up\nand close the AP interface they belong to, we get a deadlock. No\nsurprise - since we dev_close() them with the wiphy mutex held,\nwhich goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 and tries to\nacquire the wiphy mutex there.\n\nTo fix this, we need to do two things:\n 1) prevent changing iftype while AP_VLANs are up, we can't\n    easily fix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with\n    the wiphy mutex held, but change_interface() is relatively\n    rare in drivers anyway, so changing iftype isn't used much\n    (and userspace has to fall back to down/change/up anyway)\n 2) pull the dev_close() loop over VLANs out of the wiphy mutex\n    section in the normal stop case",
