  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT\n\nIn qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed\nto be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid\nto create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:\nBudimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active\nclass list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.\n\nIn 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress\nqdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent\nTC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a\nhierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into\nqdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).\n\nIn the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree\nlevels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the\niteration must stop.\n\n\n net/sched/sch_api.c | 2 +-\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)",
