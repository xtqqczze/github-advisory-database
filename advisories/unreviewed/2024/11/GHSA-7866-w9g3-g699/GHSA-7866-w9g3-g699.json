  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Prevent a bad reference count on CPU nodes\n\nWhen populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device node\nat the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a\nspecific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for\nthe node that was acquired.\n\nSince we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we\ncan simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and\nwe are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.\nThis prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.\n\nMoreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring\nthe device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.",
