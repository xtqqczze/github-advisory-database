  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda/cs_dsp_ctl: Use private_free for control cleanup\n\nUse the control private_free callback to free the associated data\nblock. This ensures that the memory won't leak, whatever way the\ncontrol gets destroyed.\n\nThe original implementation didn't actually remove the ALSA\ncontrols in hda_cs_dsp_control_remove(). It only freed the internal\ntracking structure. This meant it was possible to remove/unload the\namp driver while leaving its ALSA controls still present in the\nsoundcard. Obviously attempting to access them could cause segfaults\nor at least dereferencing stale pointers.",
