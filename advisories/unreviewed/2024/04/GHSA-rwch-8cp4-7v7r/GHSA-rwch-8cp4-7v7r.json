  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: act_mirred: don't override retval if we already lost the skb\n\nIf we're redirecting the skb, and haven't called tcf_mirred_forward(),\nyet, we need to tell the core to drop the skb by setting the retcode\nto SHOT. If we have called tcf_mirred_forward(), however, the skb\nis out of our hands and returning SHOT will lead to UaF.\n\nMove the retval override to the error path which actually need it.",
