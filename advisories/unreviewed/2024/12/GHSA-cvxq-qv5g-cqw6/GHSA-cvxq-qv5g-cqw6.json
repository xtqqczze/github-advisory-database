  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Mark raw_tp arguments with PTR_MAYBE_NULL\n\nArguments to a raw tracepoint are tagged as trusted, which carries the\nsemantics that the pointer will be non-NULL.  However, in certain cases,\na raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this\nissue is available in [0].\n\nThus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments\ncan actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never\nNULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such\npointers potentially crashing the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special\ncase the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow\npassing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp\nprograms only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id > 0, as in\nthat case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment.\n\nThe reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will\nrecheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then\nconsider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the\nPTR_MAYBE_NULL flag.\n\nTo allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads\ninto trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL.\n\nWhile trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs\nwhere such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will\ntackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can\nalready be passed into helpers and causes similar problems. Thus, they\nare left alone for now.\n\nIt is possible that these checks also permit passing non-raw_tp args\nthat are trusted PTR_TO_BTF_ID with null marking. In such a case,\nallowing dereference when pointer is NULL expands allowed behavior, so\nwon't regress existing programs, and the case of passing these into\nhelpers is the same as above and will be dealt with later.\n\nAlso update the failure case in tp_btf_nullable selftest to capture the\nnew behavior, as the verifier will no longer cause an error when\ndirectly dereference a raw tracepoint argument marked as __nullable.\n\n  [0]: https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/ZrCZS6nisraEqehw@jlelli-thinkpadt14gen4.remote.csb",
