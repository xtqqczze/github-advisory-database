  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: core: Cancel RTC work during ufshcd_remove()\n\nCurrently, RTC work is only cancelled during __ufshcd_wl_suspend(). When\nufshcd is removed in ufshcd_remove(), RTC work is not cancelled. Due to\nthis, any further trigger of the RTC work after ufshcd_remove() would\nresult in a NULL pointer dereference as below:\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000002a4\nWorkqueue: events ufshcd_rtc_work\nCall trace:\n _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x34/0x8c\n pm_runtime_get_if_active+0x24/0xb4\n ufshcd_rtc_work+0x124/0x19c\n process_scheduled_works+0x18c/0x2d8\n worker_thread+0x144/0x280\n kthread+0x11c/0x128\n ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n\nSince RTC work accesses the ufshcd internal structures, it should be cancelled\nwhen ufshcd is removed. So do that in ufshcd_remove(), as per the order in\nufshcd_init().",
