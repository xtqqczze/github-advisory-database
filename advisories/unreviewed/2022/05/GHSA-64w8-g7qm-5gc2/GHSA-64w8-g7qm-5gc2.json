  "details": "The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the diagnostics CGI (/cgi-bin/diagnostics) component responsible for emailing out information about the state of the system. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'tsrDeleteRestartedFile' or 'currentTSREmailTo' variables before making a call to system(), allowing for remote command injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the nobody user account.",
