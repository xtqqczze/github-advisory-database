  "details": "When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a static size to allocate a heap buffer yet explicitly trust a size from the file when modifying data inside of it. Due to this, an aggressor can corrupt memory outside the bounds of this buffer which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
