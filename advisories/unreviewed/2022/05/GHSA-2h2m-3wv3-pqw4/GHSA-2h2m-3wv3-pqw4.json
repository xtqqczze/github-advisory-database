  ],
  "details": "mshtml.dll in Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003, and Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (access violation) by causing mshtml.dll to process button-focus events at the same time that a document is reloading, as seen in Microsoft Office InfoPath 2003 by repeatedly clicking the \"Delete\" button in a repeating section in a form.  NOTE: the normal operation of InfoPath appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath.  If no realistic scenarios exist for this problem in other products, then perhaps it should be excluded from CVE.",
