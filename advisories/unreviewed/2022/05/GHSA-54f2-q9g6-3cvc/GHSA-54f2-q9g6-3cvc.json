Software, versions 2.4A or lower, MiniMed Paradigm Veo 554/754 pumps ? Software versions 2.6A or lower, MiniMed Paradigm Veo 554CM and 754CM models only ? Software versions 2.7A or lower, the affected insulin pumps are designed to communicate using a wireless RF with other devices, such as blood glucose meters, glucose sensor transmitters, and CareLink USB devices. This wireless RF communication protocol does not properly implement authentication or authorization. An attacker with adjacent access to one of the affected insulin pump models can inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept data. This vulnerability could also allow attackers to change pump settings and control insulin delivery.",
