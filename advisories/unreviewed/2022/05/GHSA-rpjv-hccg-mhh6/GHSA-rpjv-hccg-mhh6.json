  "details": "Certain Technicolor devices have an SNMP access-control bypass, possibly involving an ISP customization in some cases. The Technicolor (formerly Cisco) DPC3928SL with firmware D3928SL-P15-13-A386-c3420r55105-160127a could be reached by any SNMP community string from the Internet; also, you can write in the MIB because it provides write properties, aka Stringbleed. NOTE: the string-bleed/StringBleed-CVE-2017-5135 GitHub repository is not a valid reference as of 2017-04-27; it contains Trojan horse code purported to exploit this vulnerability.",
