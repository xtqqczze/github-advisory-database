  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack to manipulate an authenticated user into executing malicious actions without their awareness or consent. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a web-based management user to follow a specially crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device with the privileges of the authenticated user. These actions include modifying the device configuration, disconnecting the user's session, and executing Command Runner commands.",
