  ],
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products, aka BlueSteal. An attacker can remotely unlock any safe in this product line without a valid PIN code. Even though the phone application requires it and there is a field to supply the PIN code in an authorization request, the safe does not check the PIN code, so an attacker can obtain authorization using any value. Once an attacker sees the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement for the safe, they need only to write a BLE characteristic to enable notifications, and send a crafted getAuthor packet that returns a temporary key, and an unlock packet including that temporary key. The safe then opens after the unlock packet is processed, with no verification of PIN or other credentials.",
