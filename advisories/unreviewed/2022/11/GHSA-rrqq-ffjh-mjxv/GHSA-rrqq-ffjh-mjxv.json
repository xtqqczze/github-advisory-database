  ],
  "details": "An information-disclosure vulnerability exists on select NXP devices when configured in Serial Download Protocol (SDP) mode: i.MX RT 1010, i.MX RT 1015, i.MX RT 1020, i.MX RT 1050, i.MX RT 1060, i.MX 6 Family, i.MX 7Dual/Solo, i.MX 7ULP, i.MX 8M Quad, i.MX 8M Mini, and Vybrid. In a device security-enabled configuration, memory contents could potentially leak to physically proximate attackers via the respective SDP port in cold and warm boot attacks. (The recommended mitigation is to completely disable the SDP mode by programming a one-time programmable eFUSE. Customers can contact NXP for additional information.)",
