  "details": "An improper access control vulnerability  was found in the EZ Sync Manager of ADM, which allows authenticated users to copy arbitrary files from the server file system into their own EZSync folder. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks on the file parameter of the HTTP request. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access files outside their authorized scope, provided the file has readable permissions for other users on the underlying OS. This can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.\nAffected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 to ADM 4.3.3.RH61 as well as ADM 5.0.0.RIN1 and earlier.",
