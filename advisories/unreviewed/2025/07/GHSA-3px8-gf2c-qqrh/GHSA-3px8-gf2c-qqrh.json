  "details": "The GuiXT application, which is integrated with SAP GUI for Windows, uses obfuscation algorithms instead of secure symmetric ciphers for storing the credentials of an RFC user on the client PC. This leads to a high impact on confidentiality because any attacker who gains access to the user hive of this userï¿½s windows registry could recreate the original password. There is no impact on integrity or availability of the application",
