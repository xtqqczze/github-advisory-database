  "details": "Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some\ncases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executable\nstub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to be\nhandled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic\nto set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.\n\nFor replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the\nmetadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen from\nhandling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.",
