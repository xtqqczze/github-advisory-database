  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvideo: screen_info: Relocate framebuffers behind PCI bridges\n\nApply PCI host-bridge window offsets to screen_info framebuffers. Fixes\ninvalid access to I/O memory.\n\nResources behind a PCI host bridge can be relocated by a certain offset\nin the kernel's CPU address range used for I/O. The framebuffer memory\nrange stored in screen_info refers to the CPU addresses as seen during\nboot (where the offset is 0). During boot up, firmware may assign a\ndifferent memory offset to the PCI host bridge and thereby relocating\nthe framebuffer address of the PCI graphics device as seen by the kernel.\nThe information in screen_info must be updated as well.\n\nThe helper pcibios_bus_to_resource() performs the relocation of the\nscreen_info's framebuffer resource (given in PCI bus addresses). The\nresult matches the I/O-memory resource of the PCI graphics device (given\nin CPU addresses). As before, we store away the information necessary to\nlater update the information in screen_info itself.\n\nCommit 78aa89d1dfba (\"firmware/sysfb: Update screen_info for relocated\nEFI framebuffers\") added the code for updating screen_info. It is based\non similar functionality that pre-existed in efifb. Efifb uses a pointer\nto the PCI resource, while the newer code does a memcpy of the region.\nHence efifb sees any updates to the PCI resource and avoids the issue.\n\nv3:\n- Only use struct pci_bus_region for PCI bus addresses (Bjorn)\n- Clarify address semantics in commit messages and comments (Bjorn)\nv2:\n- Fixed tags (Takashi, Ivan)\n- Updated information on efifb",
