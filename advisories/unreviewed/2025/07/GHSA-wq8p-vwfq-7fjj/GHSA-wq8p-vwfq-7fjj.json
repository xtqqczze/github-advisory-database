  "details": "Weak Password Requirements vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation photovoltaic system monitor “EcoGuideTAB” PV-DR004J all versions and PV-DR004JA all versions allows an attacker within the Wi-Fi communication range between the units of the product (measurement unit and display unit) to derive the password from the SSID. However, the product is not affected by this vulnerability when it remains unused for a certain period of time (default: 5 minutes) and enters the power-saving mode with the display unit's LCD screen turned off. The affected products discontinued in 2015, support ended in 2020.",
