  "details": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7 and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.107, 9.3.2408.117, and 9.2.2406.121, a low-privileged user that does not hold the \"admin\" or \"power\" Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through the `User Interface - Views` configuration page that could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS).The user could cause the DoS by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability that allows for deletion of arbitrary files within a Splunk directory. The vulnerability requires the low-privileged user to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The low-privileged user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.",
