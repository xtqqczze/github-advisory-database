  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: fnic: Fix crash in fnic_wq_cmpl_handler when FDMI times out\n\nWhen both the RHBA and RPA FDMI requests time out, fnic reuses a frame to\nsend ABTS for each of them. On send completion, this causes an attempt to\nfree the same frame twice that leads to a crash.\n\nFix crash by allocating separate frames for RHBA and RPA, and modify ABTS\nlogic accordingly.\n\nTested by checking MDS for FDMI information.\n\nTested by using instrumented driver to:\n\n - Drop PLOGI response\n - Drop RHBA response\n - Drop RPA response\n - Drop RHBA and RPA response\n - Drop PLOGI response + ABTS response\n - Drop RHBA response + ABTS response\n - Drop RPA response + ABTS response\n - Drop RHBA and RPA response + ABTS response for both of them",
