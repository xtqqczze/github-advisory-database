  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write\n\nmemcg_path_store() assigns a newly allocated memory buffer to\nfilter->memcg_path, without deallocating the previously allocated and\nassigned memory buffer.  As a result, users can leak kernel memory by\ncontinuously writing a data to memcg_path DAMOS sysfs file.  Fix the leak\nby deallocating the previously set memory buffer.",
