  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: backend: fix out-of-bound write\n\nThe buffer is set to 80 character. If a caller write more characters,\ncount is truncated to the max available space in \"simple_write_to_buffer\".\nBut afterwards a string terminator is written to the buffer at offset count\nwithout boundary check. The zero termination is written OUT-OF-BOUND.\n\nAdd a check that the given buffer is smaller then the buffer to prevent.",
