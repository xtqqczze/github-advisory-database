  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmaple_tree: fix MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag in mas_preallocate()\n\nTemporarily clear the preallocation flag when explicitly requesting\nallocations.  Pre-existing allocations are already counted against the\nrequest through mas_node_count_gfp(), but the allocations will not happen\nif the MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag is set.  This flag is meant to avoid\nre-allocating in bulk allocation mode, and to detect issues with\npreallocation calculations.\n\nThe MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag should also always be set on zero allocations\nso that detection of underflow allocations will print a WARN_ON() during\nconsumption.\n\nUser visible effect of this flaw is a WARN_ON() followed by a null pointer\ndereference when subsequent requests for larger number of nodes is\nignored, such as the vma merge retry in mmap_region() caused by drivers\naltering the vma flags (which happens in v6.6, at least)",
