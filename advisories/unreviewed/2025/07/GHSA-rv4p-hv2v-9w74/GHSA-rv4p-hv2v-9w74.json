  "details": "The Taeggie Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's taeggie-feed shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.10. The pluginâ€™s render() method takes the user-supplied name attribute and injects it directly into a <script> tag - both in the id attribute and inside jQuery.getScript() - without proper escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
