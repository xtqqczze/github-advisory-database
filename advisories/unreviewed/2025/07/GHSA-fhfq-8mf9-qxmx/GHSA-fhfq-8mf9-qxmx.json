  "details": "An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam FX2 devices. Dumping Files Over HTTP and RTSP Without Authentication can occur. It lacks authentication controls on its HTTP and RTSP interfaces, allowing attackers to retrieve sensitive files and video recordings. By connecting to http://192.168.10.1/mnt/extsd/event/, an attacker can download all stored video recordings in an unencrypted manner. Additionally, the RTSP stream on port 8554 is accessible without authentication, allowing an attacker to view live footage.",
