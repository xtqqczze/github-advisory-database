  "details": "Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in Apache Commons Lang.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons Lang: Starting with commons-lang:commons-lang 2.0 to 2.6, and, from org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 3.0 before 3.18.0.\n\nThe methods ClassUtils.getClass(...) can throw StackOverflowError on very long inputs. Because an Error is usually not handled by applications and libraries, a \nStackOverflowError could cause an application to stop.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.18.0, which fixes the issue.",
