  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: export anon_inode_make_secure_inode() and fix secretmem LSM bypass\n\nExport anon_inode_make_secure_inode() to allow KVM guest_memfd to create\nanonymous inodes with proper security context. This replaces the current\npattern of calling alloc_anon_inode() followed by\ninode_init_security_anon() for creating security context manually.\n\nThis change also fixes a security regression in secretmem where the\nS_PRIVATE flag was not cleared after alloc_anon_inode(), causing\nLSM/SELinux checks to be bypassed for secretmem file descriptors.\n\nAs guest_memfd currently resides in the KVM module, we need to export this\nsymbol for use outside the core kernel. In the future, guest_memfd might be\nmoved to core-mm, at which point the symbols no longer would have to be\nexported. When/if that happens is still unclear.",
