  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add GPU cooling\n\nUnlike the CPU, the GPU does not throttle its speed automatically when it\nreaches high temperatures. With certain high GPU loads it is possible to\nreach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C, endangering the\nhardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.\n\nSet up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling the GPU speed\nwhen reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms.",
