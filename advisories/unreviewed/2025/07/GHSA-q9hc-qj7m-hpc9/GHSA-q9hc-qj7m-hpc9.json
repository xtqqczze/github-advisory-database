  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: chipidea: udc: disconnect/reconnect from host when do suspend/resume\n\nShawn and John reported a hang issue during system suspend as below:\n\n - USB gadget is enabled as Ethernet\n - There is data transfer over USB Ethernet (scp a big file between host\n                                             and device)\n - Device is going in/out suspend (echo mem > /sys/power/state)\n\nThe root cause is the USB device controller is suspended but the USB bus\nis still active which caused the USB host continues to transfer data with\ndevice and the device continues to queue USB requests (in this case, a\ndelayed TCP ACK packet trigger the issue) after controller is suspended,\nhowever the USB controller clock is already gated off. Then if udc driver\naccess registers after that point, the system will hang.\n\nThe correct way to avoid such issue is to disconnect device from host when\nthe USB bus is not at suspend state. Then the host will receive disconnect\nevent and stop data transfer in time. To continue make USB gadget device\nwork after system resume, this will reconnect device automatically.\n\nTo make usb wakeup work if USB bus is already at suspend state, this will\nkeep connection for it only when USB device controller has enabled wakeup\ncapability.",
