  ],
  "details": "A code injection vulnerability has been identified in the Robot Operating System (ROS) 'roslaunch' command-line tool, affecting ROS distributions Noetic Ninjemys and earlier. The vulnerability arises from the use of the eval() method to process user-supplied, unsanitized parameter values within the substitution args mechanism, which roslaunch evaluates before launching a node. This flaw allows attackers to craft and execute arbitrary Python code.",
