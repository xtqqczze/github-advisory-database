  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/connector: only call HDMI audio helper plugged cb if non-null\n\nOn driver remove, sound/soc/codecs/hdmi-codec.c calls the plugged_cb\nwith NULL as the callback function and codec_dev, as seen in its\nhdmi_remove function.\n\nThe HDMI audio helper then happily tries calling said null function\npointer, and produces an Oops as a result.\n\nFix this by only executing the callback if fn is non-null. This means\nthe .plugged_cb and .plugged_cb_dev members still get appropriately\ncleared.",
