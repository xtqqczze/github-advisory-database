  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86/amd: pmf: Use device managed allocations\n\nIf setting up smart PC fails for any reason then this can lead to\na double free when unloading amd-pmf.  This is because dev->buf was\nfreed but never set to NULL and is again freed in amd_pmf_remove().\n\nTo avoid subtle allocation bugs in failures leading to a double free\nchange all allocations into device managed allocations.",
