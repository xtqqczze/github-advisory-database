  ],
  "details": "The HT Contact Form Widget For Elementor Page Builder & Gutenberg Blocks & Form Builder. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file moving due to insufficient file path validation in the handle_files_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).",
