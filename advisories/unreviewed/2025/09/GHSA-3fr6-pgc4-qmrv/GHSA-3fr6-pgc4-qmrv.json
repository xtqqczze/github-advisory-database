  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write\n\nAfter nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is\nstill attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to\nnfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the\npage group.\nThe reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't\nnecessarily have a lock on the page group head.\n\nSo in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in\nnfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the\nrequest in nfs_inode_remove_request().",
