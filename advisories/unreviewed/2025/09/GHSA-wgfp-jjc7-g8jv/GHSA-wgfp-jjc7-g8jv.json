  "details": "The Bevy Event service through 2025-07-22, as used for eBay Seller Events and other activities, allows account takeover, if SSO is used, when a victim changes the email address that they have configured. To exploit this, an attacker would create their own account and perform an SSO login. The root cause of the issue is SSO misconfiguration.",
