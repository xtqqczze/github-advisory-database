  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn->n samples\n\nThe `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as a default handler for\n`INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for\n`INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a default\nhandler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler\nfor `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed\n`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`\ninstructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,\nindicated by the `insn->n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently\nonly handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will\ncopy `insn->n` samples back to user-space.  (That triggered KASAN\nkernel-infoleak errors when `insn->n` was greater than 1, but that is\nbeing fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)\n\nMake `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either handle `insn->n` samples, or return\nan error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ` and\n`INSN_WRITE` handlers.",
