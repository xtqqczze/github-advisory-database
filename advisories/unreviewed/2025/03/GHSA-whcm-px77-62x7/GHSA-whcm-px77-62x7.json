  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/khugepaged: fix ->anon_vma race\n\nIf an ->anon_vma is attached to the VMA, collapse_and_free_pmd() requires\nit to be locked.\n\nPage table traversal is allowed under any one of the mmap lock, the\nanon_vma lock (if the VMA is associated with an anon_vma), and the\nmapping lock (if the VMA is associated with a mapping); and so to be\nable to remove page tables, we must hold all three of them. \nretract_page_tables() bails out if an ->anon_vma is attached, but does\nthis check before holding the mmap lock (as the comment above the check\nexplains).\n\nIf we racily merged an existing ->anon_vma (shared with a child\nprocess) from a neighboring VMA, subsequent rmap traversals on pages\nbelonging to the child will be able to see the page tables that we are\nconcurrently removing while assuming that nothing else can access them.\n\nRepeat the ->anon_vma check once we hold the mmap lock to ensure that\nthere really is no concurrent page table access.\n\nHitting this bug causes a lockdep warning in collapse_and_free_pmd(),\nin the line \"lockdep_assert_held_write(&vma->anon_vma->root->rwsem)\". \nIt can also lead to use-after-free access.",
