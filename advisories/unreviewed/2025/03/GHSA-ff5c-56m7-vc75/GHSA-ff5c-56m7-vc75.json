  ],
  "details": "OpenWebUI version 0.3.0 contains a vulnerability in the audio API endpoint `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions` that allows for arbitrary file upload. The application performs insufficient validation on the `file.content_type` and allows user-controlled filenames, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This can be exploited by an authenticated user to overwrite critical files within the Docker container, potentially leading to remote code execution as the root user.",
