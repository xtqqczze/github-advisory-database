  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in infiniflow/ragflow versions v0.12.0 allows for remote code execution. The RPC server in RagFlow uses a hard-coded AuthKey 'authkey=b'infiniflow-token4kevinhu'' which can be easily fetched by attackers to join the group communication without restrictions. Additionally, the server processes incoming data using pickle deserialization via `pickle.loads()` on `connection.recv()`, making it vulnerable to remote code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.14.0.",
