  "details": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of vanna-ai/vanna when using DuckDB as the database. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted SQL queries that leverage DuckDB's default features, such as `read_csv`, `read_csv_auto`, `read_text`, and `read_blob`, to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, internal systems, and potentially further attacks.",
