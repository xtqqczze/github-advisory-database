  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390: workaround invalid gcc-11 out of bounds read warning\n\nGCC 11.1.0 and 11.2.0 generate a wrong warning when compiling the\nkernel e.g. with allmodconfig:\n\narch/s390/kernel/setup.c: In function ‘setup_lowcore_dat_on’:\n./include/linux/fortify-string.h:57:33: error: ‘__builtin_memcpy’ reading 128 bytes from a region of size 0 [-Werror=stringop-overread]\n...\narch/s390/kernel/setup.c:526:9: note: in expansion of macro ‘memcpy’\n  526 |         memcpy(abs_lc->cregs_save_area, S390_lowcore.cregs_save_area,\n      |         ^~~~~~\n\nThis could be addressed by using absolute_pointer() with the\nS390_lowcore macro, but this is not a good idea since this generates\nworse code for performance critical paths.\n\nTherefore simply use a for loop to copy the array in question and get\nrid of the warning.",
