  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the `ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv()` API of the `dmlc/gluon-cv` repository, version 0.10.0, allows for arbitrary file write. The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a TarSlip vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's system via path traversal or faked symlinks.",
