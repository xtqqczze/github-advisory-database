  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: Don't null dereference ops->destroy\n\nA KVM device cleanup happens in either of two callbacks:\n1) destroy() which is called when the VM is being destroyed;\n2) release() which is called when a device fd is closed.\n\nMost KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices\n(XICS, XIVE, XIVE-native) use 2) as they need to close and reopen during\nthe machine execution. The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device()\nassumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as\ndiscovered by Syzkaller.\n\nThis adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().\n\nThis is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined\nrelease() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.",
