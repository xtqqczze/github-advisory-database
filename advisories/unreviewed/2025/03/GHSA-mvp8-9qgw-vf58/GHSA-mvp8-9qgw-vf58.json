  "details": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in open-mmlab/mmdetection version v3.3.0. The vulnerability is due to the use of the `pickle.loads()` function in the `all_reduce_dict()` distributed training API without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by broadcasting a malicious payload to the distributed training network.",
