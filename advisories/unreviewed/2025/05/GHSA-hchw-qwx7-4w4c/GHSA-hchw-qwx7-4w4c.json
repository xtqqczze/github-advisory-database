  "details": "A flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers using `\\r\\n\\rX` instead of the required `\\r\\n\\r\\n`.\nThis inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.\n\nThe issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination.\n\nImpact:\n* This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.",
