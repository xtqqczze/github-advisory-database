  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: always do atomic put from iowq\n\nio_uring always switches requests to atomic refcounting for iowq\nexecution before there is any parallilism by setting REQ_F_REFCOUNT,\nand the flag is not cleared until the request completes. That should be\nfine as long as the compiler doesn't make up a non existing value for\nthe flags, however KCSAN still complains when the request owner changes\noter flag bits:\n\nBUG: KCSAN: data-race in io_req_task_cancel / io_wq_free_work\n...\nread to 0xffff888117207448 of 8 bytes by task 3871 on cpu 0:\n req_ref_put_and_test io_uring/refs.h:22 [inline]\n\nSkip REQ_F_REFCOUNT checks for iowq, we know it's set.",
