  "details": "On affected platforms running Arista EOS with Traffic Policies configured the vulnerability will cause received untagged packets not to hit Traffic Policy rules that they are expected to hit. If the rule was to drop the packet, the packet will not be dropped and instead will be forwarded as if the rule was not in place. This could lead to packets being delivered to unexpected destinations.",
