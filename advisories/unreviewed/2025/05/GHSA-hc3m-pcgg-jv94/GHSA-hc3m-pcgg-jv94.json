  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc64/ftrace: fix module loading without patchable function entries\n\nget_stubs_size assumes that there must always be at least one patchable\nfunction entry, which is not always the case (modules that export data\nbut no code), otherwise it returns -ENOEXEC and thus the section header\nsh_size is set to that value. During module_memory_alloc() the size is\npassed to execmem_alloc() after being page-aligned and thus set to zero\nwhich will cause it to fail the allocation (and thus module loading) as\n__vmalloc_node_range() checks for zero-sized allocs and returns null:\n\n[  115.466896] module_64: cast_common: doesn't contain __patchable_function_entries.\n[  115.469189] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  115.469496] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 274 at mm/vmalloc.c:3778 __vmalloc_node_range_noprof+0x8b4/0x8f0\n...\n[  115.478574] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n[  115.479545] execmem: unable to allocate memory\n\nFix this by removing the check completely, since it is anyway not\nhelpful to propagate this as an error upwards.",
