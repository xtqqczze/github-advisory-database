  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer\n\nThe XOL (execute out-of-line) buffer is used to single-step the\nreplaced instruction(s) for uprobes. The RISC-V port was missing a\nproper fence.i (i$ flushing) after constructing the XOL buffer, which\ncan result in incorrect execution of stale/broken instructions.\n\nThis was found running the BPF selftests \"test_progs:\nuprobe_autoattach, attach_probe\" on the Spacemit K1/X60, where the\nuprobes tests randomly blew up.",
