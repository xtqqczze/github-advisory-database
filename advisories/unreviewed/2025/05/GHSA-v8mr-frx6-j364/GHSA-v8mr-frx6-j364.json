  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxenbus: Use kref to track req lifetime\n\nMarek reported seeing a NULL pointer fault in the xenbus_thread\ncallstack:\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\nRIP: e030:__wake_up_common+0x4c/0x180\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n __wake_up_common_lock+0x82/0xd0\n process_msg+0x18e/0x2f0\n xenbus_thread+0x165/0x1c0\n\nprocess_msg+0x18e is req->cb(req).  req->cb is set to xs_wake_up(), a\nthin wrapper around wake_up(), or xenbus_dev_queue_reply().  It seems\nlike it was xs_wake_up() in this case.\n\nIt seems like req may have woken up the xs_wait_for_reply(), which\nkfree()ed the req.  When xenbus_thread resumes, it faults on the zero-ed\ndata.\n\nLinux Device Drivers 2nd edition states:\n\"Normally, a wake_up call can cause an immediate reschedule to happen,\nmeaning that other processes might run before wake_up returns.\"\n... which would match the behaviour observed.\n\nChange to keeping two krefs on each request.  One for the caller, and\none for xenbus_thread.  Each will kref_put() when finished, and the last\nwill free it.\n\nThis use of kref matches the description in\nDocumentation/core-api/kref.rst",
