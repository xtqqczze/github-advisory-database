  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/9p: use a dedicated spinlock for trans_fd\n\nShamelessly copying the explanation from Tetsuo Handa's suggested\npatch[1] (slightly reworded):\nsyzbot is reporting inconsistent lock state in p9_req_put()[2],\nfor p9_tag_remove() from p9_req_put() from IRQ context is using\nspin_lock_irqsave() on \"struct p9_client\"->lock but trans_fd\n(not from IRQ context) is using spin_lock().\n\nSince the locks actually protect different things in client.c and in\ntrans_fd.c, just replace trans_fd.c's lock by a new one specific to the\ntransport (client.c's protect the idr for fid/tag allocations,\nwhile trans_fd.c's protects its own req list and request status field\nthat acts as the transport's state machine)",
