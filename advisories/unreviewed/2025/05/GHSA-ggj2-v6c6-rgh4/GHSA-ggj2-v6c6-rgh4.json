  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: light: opt3001: fix deadlock due to concurrent flag access\n\nThe threaded IRQ function in this driver is reading the flag twice: once to\nlock a mutex and once to unlock it. Even though the code setting the flag\nis designed to prevent it, there are subtle cases where the flag could be\ntrue at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This\nresults in the mutex not being unlocked, resulting in a deadlock.\n\nFix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust, reading the\nflag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.",
