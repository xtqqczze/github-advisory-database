  "details": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in fossasia open-event-server 1.19.1. This issue affects the function send_email_change_user_email of the file /fossasia/open-event-server/blob/development/app/api/helpers/mail.py of the component Mail Verification Handler. The manipulation leads to reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
