  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: dev: fix skb drop check\n\nIn commit a6d190f8c767 (\"can: skb: drop tx skb if in listen only\nmode\") the priv->ctrlmode element is read even on virtual CAN\ninterfaces that do not create the struct can_priv at startup. This\nout-of-bounds read may lead to CAN frame drops for virtual CAN\ninterfaces like vcan and vxcan.\n\nThis patch mainly reverts the original commit and adds a new helper\nfor CAN interface drivers that provide the required information in\nstruct can_priv.\n\n[mkl: patch pch_can, too]",
