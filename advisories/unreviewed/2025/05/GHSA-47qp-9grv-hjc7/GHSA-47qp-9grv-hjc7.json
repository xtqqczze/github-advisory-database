  "details": "The EG-Series plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's [series] shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes in the shortcode_title function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers - with contributor-level access and above, on sites with the Classic Editor plugin activated - to inject arbitrary JavaScript code in the titletag attribute that will execute whenever a user access an injected page.",
