This vulnerability enables malicious actors to create new user accounts without proper authorization.\n\nExploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker to create multiple low-privileged user accounts, gaining unauthorized access to the system. Additionally, continuous exploitation could lead to system resource exhaustion through mass user creation.",
