  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()\n\nThere are actually 2 problems:\n- deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements\n  [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.\n- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last\n  element is out of bounds.\n\nThe out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being\naccessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes\nin active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds\nelement is part of an unmapped page.",
