An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a messaging chat entry point in the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. The application may not recover on its own and may need an administrator to manually restart services to recover.",
