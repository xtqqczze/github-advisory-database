  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndevlink: fix xa_alloc_cyclic() error handling\n\nIn case of returning 1 from xa_alloc_cyclic() (wrapping) ERR_PTR(1) will\nbe returned, which will cause IS_ERR() to be false. Which can lead to\ndereference not allocated pointer (rel).\n\nFix it by checking if err is lower than zero.\n\nThis wasn't found in real usecase, only noticed. Credit to Pierre.",
