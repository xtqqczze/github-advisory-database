  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath11k: update channel list in reg notifier instead reg worker\n\nCurrently when ath11k gets a new channel list, it will be processed\naccording to the following steps:\n1. update new channel list to cfg80211 and queue reg_work.\n2. cfg80211 handles new channel list during reg_work.\n3. update cfg80211's handled channel list to firmware by\nath11k_reg_update_chan_list().\n\nBut ath11k will immediately execute step 3 after reg_work is just\nqueued. Since step 2 is asynchronous, cfg80211 may not have completed\nhandling the new channel list, which may leading to an out-of-bounds\nwrite error:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ath11k_reg_update_chan_list\nCall Trace:\n    ath11k_reg_update_chan_list+0xbfe/0xfe0 [ath11k]\n    kfree+0x109/0x3a0\n    ath11k_regd_update+0x1cf/0x350 [ath11k]\n    ath11k_regd_update_work+0x14/0x20 [ath11k]\n    process_one_work+0xe35/0x14c0\n\nShould ensure step 2 is completely done before executing step 3. Thus\nWen raised patch[1]. When flag NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER is set,\ncfg80211 will notify ath11k after step 2 is done.\n\nSo enable the flag NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER then cfg80211 will\nnotify ath11k after step 2 is done. At this time, there will be no\nKASAN bug during the execution of the step 3.\n\n[1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-wireless/patch/20230201065313.27203-1-quic_wgong@quicinc.com/\n\nTested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3",
