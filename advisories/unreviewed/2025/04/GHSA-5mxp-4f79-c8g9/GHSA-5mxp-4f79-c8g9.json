  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetmem: prevent TX of unreadable skbs\n\nCurrently on stable trees we have support for netmem/devmem RX but not\nTX. It is not safe to forward/redirect an RX unreadable netmem packet\ninto the device's TX path, as the device may call dma-mapping APIs on\ndma addrs that should not be passed to it.\n\nFix this by preventing the xmit of unreadable skbs.\n\nTested by configuring tc redirect:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 ingress\nsudo tc filter add dev eth1 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower ip_proto \\\n\ttcp src_ip 192.168.1.12 action mirred egress redirect dev eth1\n\nBefore, I see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma\nmapping APIs.\n\nAfter, I don't see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma\nmapping APIs.",
