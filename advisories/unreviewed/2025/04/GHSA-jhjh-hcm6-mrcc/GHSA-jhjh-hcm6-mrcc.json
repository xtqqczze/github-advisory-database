  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nobjtool, spi: amd: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in amd_set_spi_freq()\n\nIf speed_hz < AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ, amd_set_spi_freq() iterates over the\nentire amd_spi_freq array without breaking out early, causing 'i' to go\nbeyond the array bounds.\n\nFix that by stopping the loop when it gets to the last entry, so the low\nspeed_hz value gets clamped up to AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ.\n\nFixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:\n\n  drivers/spi/spi-amd.o: error: objtool: amd_set_spi_freq() falls through to next function amd_spi_set_opcode()",
