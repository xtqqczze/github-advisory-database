  "details": "Overview \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '.../...//' (doubled triple dot slash) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. (CWE-35) \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDescription \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHitachi Vantara Pentaho Data Integration & Analytics versions before 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, do not sanitize a user input used as a file path through the UploadFile service. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nImpact \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.",
