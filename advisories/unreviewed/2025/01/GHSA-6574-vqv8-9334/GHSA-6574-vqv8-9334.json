  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled\n\nWhen a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the\ntracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled\n(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent\nbuffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",
