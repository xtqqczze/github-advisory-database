  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE\n\nCurrently poe_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl' variable,\nand a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this\nuninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to\ntarget->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from\nthe kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,\nand the issue does not provide a write mechanism.\n\nFix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset\nfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,\nNT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing\ncontents of POR_EL1 will be retained.\n\nBefore this patch:\n\n| # ./poe-test\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n|\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0xffff8000839c3d50\n\nAfter this patch:\n\n| # ./poe-test\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d\n|\n| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)\n| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes\n|\n| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0\n| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes\n| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d",
