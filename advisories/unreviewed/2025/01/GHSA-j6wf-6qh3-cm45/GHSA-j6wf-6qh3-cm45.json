  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Have process_string() also allow arrays\n\nIn order to catch a common bug where a TRACE_EVENT() TP_fast_assign()\nassigns an address of an allocated string to the ring buffer and then\nreferences it in TP_printk(), which can be executed hours later when the\nstring is free, the function test_event_printk() runs on all events as\nthey are registered to make sure there's no unwanted dereferencing.\n\nIt calls process_string() to handle cases in TP_printk() format that has\n\"%s\". It returns whether or not the string is safe. But it can have some\nfalse positives.\n\nFor instance, xe_bo_move() has:\n\n TP_printk(\"move_lacks_source:%s, migrate object %p [size %zu] from %s to %s device_id:%s\",\n            __entry->move_lacks_source ? \"yes\" : \"no\", __entry->bo, __entry->size,\n            xe_mem_type_to_name[__entry->old_placement],\n            xe_mem_type_to_name[__entry->new_placement], __get_str(device_id))\n\nWhere the \"%s\" references into xe_mem_type_to_name[]. This is an array of\npointers that should be safe for the event to access. Instead of flagging\nthis as a bad reference, if a reference points to an array, where the\nrecord field is the index, consider it safe.",
