  "details": "The specific component in Celk Saude 3.1.252.1 that processes user input and returns error messages to the client is vulnerable due to improper validation or sanitization of the \"erro\" parameter. This parameter appears as a response when incorrect credentials are entered during login. The lack of proper validation or sanitization makes the component susceptible to injection attacks, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the input and exploit the system.",
