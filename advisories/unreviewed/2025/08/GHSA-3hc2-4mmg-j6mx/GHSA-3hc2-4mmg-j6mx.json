  "details": "The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to missing nonce validations in the edd_sendwp_disconnect() and edd_sendwp_remote_install() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate or download and activate the SendWP plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
