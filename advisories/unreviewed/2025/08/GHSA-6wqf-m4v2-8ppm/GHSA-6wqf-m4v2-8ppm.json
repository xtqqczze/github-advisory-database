  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/sched: Increment job count before swapping tail spsc queue\n\nA small race exists between spsc_queue_push and the run-job worker, in\nwhich spsc_queue_push may return not-first while the run-job worker has\nalready idled due to the job count being zero. If this race occurs, job\nscheduling stops, leading to hangs while waiting on the jobâ€™s DMA\nfences.\n\nSeal this race by incrementing the job count before appending to the\nSPSC queue.\n\nThis race was observed on a drm-tip 6.16-rc1 build with the Xe driver in\nan SVM test case.",
