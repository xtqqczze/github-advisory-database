  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: libwx: fix the using of Rx buffer DMA\n\nThe wx_rx_buffer structure contained two DMA address fields: 'dma' and\n'page_dma'. However, only 'page_dma' was actually initialized and used\nto program the Rx descriptor. But 'dma' was uninitialized and used in\nsome paths.\n\nThis could lead to undefined behavior, including DMA errors or\nuse-after-free, if the uninitialized 'dma' was used. Althrough such\nerror has not yet occurred, it is worth fixing in the code.",
