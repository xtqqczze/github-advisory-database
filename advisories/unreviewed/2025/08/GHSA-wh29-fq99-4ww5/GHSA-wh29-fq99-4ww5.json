  "details": "CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw\nThis vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.\n\nAlthough some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.\n\n\n\nAs a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.\n\nThe issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.\n\nImpact\n\nBy injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:\n\n  *  Break the current HTTP header\n  *  Inject a new header or entire body\n  *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response\nThat can lead to the following attacks:\n\n  *  reflected XSS\n  *  open redirect\n  *  cache poisoning\n  *  header manipulation",
