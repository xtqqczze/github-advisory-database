  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: handle jset (if a & b ...) as a jump in CFG computation\n\nBPF_JSET is a conditional jump and currently verifier.c:can_jump()\ndoes not know about that. This can lead to incorrect live registers\nand SCC computation.\n\nE.g. in the following example:\n\n   1: r0 = 1;\n   2: r2 = 2;\n   3: if r1 & 0x7 goto +1;\n   4: exit;\n   5: r0 = r2;\n   6: exit;\n\nW/o this fix insn_successors(3) will return only (4), a jump to (5)\nwould be missed and r2 won't be marked as alive at (3).",
