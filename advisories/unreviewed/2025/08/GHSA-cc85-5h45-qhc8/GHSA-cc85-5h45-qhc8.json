  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns\n\nWhat we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something\nhidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  \"Wouldn't be able to undo\"\nmay be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from\nlacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.\n\nclone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.\n\nThere's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various\nuserns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve\ndifferent purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,\nbut not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.",
