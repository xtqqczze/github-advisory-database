  "details": "The AnWP Football Leagues plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all versions up to, and including, 0.16.17 via the 'download_csv_players' and 'download_csv_games' functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.",
