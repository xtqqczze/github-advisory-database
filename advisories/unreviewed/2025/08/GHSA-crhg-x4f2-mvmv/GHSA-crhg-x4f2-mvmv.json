  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/rockchip: vop2: fail cleanly if missing a primary plane for a video-port\n\nEach window of a vop2 is usable by a specific set of video ports, so while\nbinding the vop2, we look through the list of available windows trying to\nfind one designated as primary-plane and usable by that specific port.\n\nThe code later wants to use drm_crtc_init_with_planes with that found\nprimary plane, but nothing has checked so far if a primary plane was\nactually found.\n\nFor whatever reason, the rk3576 vp2 does not have a usable primary window\n(if vp0 is also in use) which brought the issue to light and ended in a\nnull-pointer dereference further down.\n\nAs we expect a primary-plane to exist for a video-port, add a check at\nthe end of the window-iteration and fail probing if none was found.",
