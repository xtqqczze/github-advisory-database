  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: No more self recovery\n\nWhen a node withdraws and it turns out that it is the only node that has\nthe filesystem mounted, gfs2 currently tries to replay the local journal\nto bring the filesystem back into a consistent state.  Not only is that\na very bad idea, it has also never worked because gfs2_recover_func()\nwill refuse to do anything during a withdraw.\n\nHowever, before even getting to this point, gfs2_recover_func()\ndereferences sdp->sd_jdesc->jd_inode.  This was a use-after-free before\ncommit 04133b607a78 (\"gfs2: Prevent double iput for journal on error\")\nand is a NULL pointer dereference since then.\n\nSimply get rid of self recovery to fix that.",
