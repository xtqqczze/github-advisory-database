  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug\n\nWhen the root of a nested PCIe bridge configuration is unplugged, the\npnv_php driver leaked the allocated IRQ resources for the child bridges'\nhotplug event notifications, resulting in a panic.\n\nFix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources\nbefore calling pci_hp_remove_devices().\n\nAlso modify the lifetime of the workqueue at struct pnv_php_slot::wq so\nthat it is only destroyed in pnv_php_free_slot(), instead of\npnv_php_disable_irq(). This is required since pnv_php_disable_irq() will\nnow be called by workers triggered by hot unplug interrupts, so the\nworkqueue needs to stay allocated.\n\nThe abridged kernel panic that occurs without this patch is as follows:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 687 at kernel/irq/msi.c:292 msi_device_data_release+0x6c/0x9c\n  CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 687 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.14.0-rc5+ #2\n  Call Trace:\n   msi_device_data_release+0x34/0x9c (unreliable)\n   release_nodes+0x64/0x13c\n   devres_release_all+0xc0/0x140\n   device_del+0x2d4/0x46c\n   pci_destroy_dev+0x5c/0x194\n   pci_hp_remove_devices+0x90/0x128\n   pci_hp_remove_devices+0x44/0x128\n   pnv_php_disable_slot+0x54/0xd4\n   power_write_file+0xf8/0x18c\n   pci_slot_attr_store+0x40/0x5c\n   sysfs_kf_write+0x64/0x78\n   kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x1b0/0x290\n   vfs_write+0x3bc/0x50c\n   ksys_write+0x84/0x140\n   system_call_exception+0x124/0x230\n   system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec\n\n[bhelgaas: tidy comments]",
