  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: Fix copy buffer page size\n\nFor non-registered buffer, fastrpc driver copies the buffer and\npass it to the remote subsystem. There is a problem with current\nimplementation of page size calculation which is not considering\nthe offset in the calculation. This might lead to passing of\nimproper and out-of-bounds page size which could result in\nmemory issue. Calculate page start and page end using the offset\nadjusted address instead of absolute address.",
