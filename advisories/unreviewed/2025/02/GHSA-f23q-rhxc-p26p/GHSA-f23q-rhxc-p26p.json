  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number\n\nOn MSM8916 devices, the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does\nnot change across individual devices. It's always:\n\n  db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number\n  2644893864\n\nThe firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does not\nhave support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an\nexisting check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's\nnot correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make\nsure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparing\nwith the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916\ndevices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo\nstruct in SMEM.\n\nFix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of the\nfield is also taken into account.",
