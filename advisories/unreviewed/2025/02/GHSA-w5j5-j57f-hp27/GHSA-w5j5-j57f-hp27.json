  "details": "The Thunderbird Address Book URI fields contained unsanitized links. This could be used by an attacker to create and export an address book containing a malicious payload in a field. For example, in the “Other” field of the Instant Messaging section. If another user imported the address book, clicking on the link could result in opening a web page inside Thunderbird, and that page could execute (unprivileged) JavaScript.
