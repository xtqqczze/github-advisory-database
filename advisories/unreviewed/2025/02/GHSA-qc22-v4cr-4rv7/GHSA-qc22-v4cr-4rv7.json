  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: uvcvideo: Remove dangling pointers\n\nWhen an async control is written, we copy a pointer to the file handle\nthat started the operation. That pointer will be used when the device is\ndone. Which could be anytime in the future.\n\nIf the user closes that file descriptor, its structure will be freed,\nand there will be one dangling pointer per pending async control, that\nthe driver will try to use.\n\nClean all the dangling pointers during release().\n\nTo avoid adding a performance penalty in the most common case (no async\noperation), a counter has been introduced with some logic to make sure\nthat it is properly handled.",
