  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvideo: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup\n\nCommit b3c9a924aab6 (\"fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather\nthan .remove\") fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing\nthe fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.\n\nThis can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove\ncallback, since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.\n\nBut that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is\nthat .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example, if no\nprocess has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.\n\nIf that's the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is\ncalled, making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that\nto no longer be valid.\n\nTo prevent that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen\nbefore the unregister_framebuffer() function call.",
