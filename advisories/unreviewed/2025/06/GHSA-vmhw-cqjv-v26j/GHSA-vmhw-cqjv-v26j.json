  "details": "The AuthPolicy metadata on Red Hat Connectivity Link contains an object which stores secretes, however it assumes those secretes are already in the kuadrant-system instead of copying it to the referred namespace. This creates space for a malicious actor with a developer persona access to leak those secrets over HTTP connection, as long the attacker knows the name of the targeted secrets and those secrets are limited to one line only.",
