  "details": "Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial ble_process_esp32_msg Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial EV chargers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the ble_process_esp32_msg function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26369.",
