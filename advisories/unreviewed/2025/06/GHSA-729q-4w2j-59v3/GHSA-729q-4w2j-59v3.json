  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkunit: executor: Fix a memory leak on failure in kunit_filter_tests\n\nIt's possible that memory allocation for 'filtered' will fail, but for the\ncopy of the suite to succeed. In this case, the copy could be leaked.\n\nProperly free 'copy' in the error case for the allocation of 'filtered'\nfailing.\n\nNote that there may also have been a similar issue in\nkunit_filter_subsuites, before it was removed in \"kunit: flatten\nkunit_suite*** to kunit_suite** in .kunit_test_suites\".\n\nThis was reported by clang-analyzer via the kernel test robot, here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/c8073b8e-7b9e-0830-4177-87c12f16349c@intel.com/\n\nAnd by smatch via Dan Carpenter and the kernel test robot:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/202207101328.ASjx88yj-lkp@intel.com/",
