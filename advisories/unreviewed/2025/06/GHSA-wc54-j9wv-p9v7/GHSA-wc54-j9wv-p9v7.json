  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: Intel: cnl: Do not process IPC reply before firmware boot\n\nIt is not yet clear, but it is possible to create a firmware so broken\nthat it will send a reply message before a FW_READY message (it is not\nyet clear if FW_READY will arrive later).\nSince the reply_data is allocated only after the FW_READY message, this\nwill lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not filtered out.\n\nThe issue was reported with IPC4 firmware but the same condition is present\nfor IPC3.",
