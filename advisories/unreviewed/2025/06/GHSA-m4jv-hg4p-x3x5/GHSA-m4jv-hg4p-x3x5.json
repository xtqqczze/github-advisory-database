  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware_loader: Fix use-after-free during unregister\n\nIn the following code within firmware_upload_unregister(), the call to\ndevice_unregister() could result in the dev_release function freeing the\nfw_upload_priv structure before it is dereferenced for the call to\nmodule_put(). This bug was found by the kernel test robot using\nCONFIG_KASAN while running the firmware selftests.\n\n  device_unregister(&fw_sysfs->dev);\n  module_put(fw_upload_priv->module);\n\nThe problem is fixed by copying fw_upload_priv->module to a local variable\nfor use when calling device_unregister().",
