  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsch_hfsc: Fix qlen accounting bug when using peek in hfsc_enqueue()\n\nWhen enqueuing the first packet to an HFSC class, hfsc_enqueue() calls the\nchild qdisc's peek() operation before incrementing sch->q.qlen and\nsch->qstats.backlog. If the child qdisc uses qdisc_peek_dequeued(), this may\ntrigger an immediate dequeue and potential packet drop. In such cases,\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is called, but the HFSC qdisc's qlen and backlog\nhave not yet been updated, leading to inconsistent queue accounting. This\ncan leave an empty HFSC class in the active list, causing further\nconsequences like use-after-free.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug by moving the increment of sch->q.qlen and\nsch->qstats.backlog before the call to the child qdisc's peek() operation.\nThis ensures that queue length and backlog are always accurate when packet\ndrops or dequeues are triggered during the peek.",
