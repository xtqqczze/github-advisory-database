  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstmmac: intel: Add a missing clk_disable_unprepare() call in intel_eth_pci_remove()\n\nCommit 09f012e64e4b (\"stmmac: intel: Fix clock handling on error and remove\npaths\") removed this clk_disable_unprepare()\n\nThis was partly revert by commit ac322f86b56c (\"net: stmmac: Fix clock\nhandling on remove path\") which removed this clk_disable_unprepare()\nbecause:\n\"\n   While unloading the dwmac-intel driver, clk_disable_unprepare() is\n   being called twice in stmmac_dvr_remove() and\n   intel_eth_pci_remove(). This causes kernel panic on the second call.\n\"\n\nHowever later on, commit 5ec55823438e8 (\"net: stmmac: add clocks management\nfor gmac driver\") has updated stmmac_dvr_remove() which do not call\nclk_disable_unprepare() anymore.\n\nSo this call should now be called from intel_eth_pci_remove().",
