  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/rtas: Fix RTAS MSR[HV] handling for Cell\n\nThe semi-recent changes to MSR handling when entering RTAS (firmware)\ncause crashes on IBM Cell machines. An example trace:\n\n  kernel tried to execute user page (2fff01a8) - exploit attempt?
