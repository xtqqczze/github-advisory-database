  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nposix-cpu-timers: Cleanup CPU timers before freeing them during exec\n\nCommit 55e8c8eb2c7b (\"posix-cpu-timers: Store a reference to a pid not a\ntask\") started looking up tasks by PID when deleting a CPU timer.\n\nWhen a non-leader thread calls execve, it will switch PIDs with the leader\nprocess. Then, as it calls exit_itimers, posix_cpu_timer_del cannot find\nthe task because the timer still points out to the old PID.\n\nThat means that armed timers won't be disarmed, that is, they won't be\nremoved from the timerqueue_list. exit_itimers will still release their\nmemory, and when that list is later processed, it leads to a\nuse-after-free.\n\nClean up the timers from the de-threaded task before freeing them. This\nprevents a reported use-after-free.",
