  "details": "SunGrow's back end users system  iSolarCloud https://isolarcloud.com  uses an MQTT service to transport data from the user's connected devices to the user's web browser. \nThe MQTT server however did not have sufficient restrictions in place to limit the topics that a user could subscribe to. \nWhile the data that is transmitted through the MQTT server is encrypted and the credentials for the MQTT server are obtained though an API call, the credentials could be used to subscribe to any topic and the encryption key can be used to decrypt all messages received.\nAn attack with an account on iSolarCloud.com could extract MQTT credentials and the decryption key from the browser and then use an external program to subscribe to the topic '#' and thus recieve all messages from all connected devices.",
