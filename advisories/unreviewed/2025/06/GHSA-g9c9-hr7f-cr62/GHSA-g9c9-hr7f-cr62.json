  "details": "A SQLi vulnerability in RSMediaGallery component 1.7.4 - 2.1.6 for Joomla was discovered. The vulnerability is due to the use of unescaped user-supplied parameters in SQL queries within the dashboard component. This allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious SQL code through unsanitized input fields, which are used directly in SQL queries.
