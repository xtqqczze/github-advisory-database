Attackers can bypass authentication by including specially crafted text in the request URL or message header, and then inject arbitrary malicious commands into some fields related to ACL access control list and user group functions and execute to obtain the highest ROOT privileges of remote devices, thereby completely taking over the remote target devices.",
