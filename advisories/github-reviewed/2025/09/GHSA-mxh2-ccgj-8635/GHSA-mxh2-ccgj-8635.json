  "summary": "ESP-IDF web_server basic auth bypass using empty or incomplete Authorization header",
  "details": "### Summary\nOn the ESP-IDF platform, ESPHome's [`web_server` authentication](https://esphome.io/components/web_server.html#configuration-variables) check can pass incorrectly when the client-supplied base64-encoded `Authorization` value is empty or is a substring of the correct value (e.g., correct username with partial password). This allows access to `web_server` functionality (including OTA, if enabled) without knowing any information about the correct username or password.\n\n### Details\nThe HTTP basic auth check in `web_server_idf`'s [`AsyncWebServerRequest::authenticate`](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/blob/ef2121a215890d46dc1d25ad363611ecadc9e25e/esphome/components/web_server_idf/web_server_idf.cpp#L256) only compares up to `auth.value().size() - auth_prefix_len` bytes of the base64-encoded `user:pass` string. This means a client-provided valuer like `dXNlcjpz` (`user:s`) will pass the check when the correct value is much longer, e.g., `dXNlcjpzb21lcmVhbGx5bG9uZ3Bhc3M=` (`user:somereallylongpass`).\n\nFurthermore, the check will also pass when the supplied value is the empty string, which removes the need to know (or brute force) the username. A browser won't generally issue such a request, but it can easily be done by manually constructing the `Authorizaztion` request header (e.g., via `curl`).\n\n### PoC\nConfigure ESPHome as follows:\n\n```yaml\nesp32:\n  board: ...\n  framework:\n    type: esp-idf\nweb_server:\n  auth:\n    username: user\n    password: somereallylongpass\n```\n\nIn a browser, you can correctly log in by supplying username `user` and password `somereallylongpass`... but you can _also_ incorrectly log in by supplying _substrings_ of the password whose base64-encoded digest matches a _prefix_ of the correct digest. (For example, I was able to log into an ESPHome device so configured by supplying password `some`... or even just `s`.)\n\nYou can also use a tool like `curl` to manually set an `Authorization` request header that _always_ passes the check without any knowledge of the username:\n\n```\n$ curl -D- http://example.local/\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n...\n\n$ curl -D- -H 'Authorization: Basic ' http://example.local/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability effectively nullifies basic auth support for the ESP-IDF `web_server`, allowing auth bypass from another device on the local network with no knowledge of the correct username or password required.\n\n### Remediation\nThis vulnerability is fixed in 2025.8.1 and later.\n\nFor older versions, disabling the `web_server` component on ESP-IDF devices may be prudent, particularly if OTA updates through `web_server` are enabled.",
