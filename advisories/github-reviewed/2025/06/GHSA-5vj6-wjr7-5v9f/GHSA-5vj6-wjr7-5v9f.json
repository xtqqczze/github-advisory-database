  "summary": "n8n allows open redirects via the /signin endpoint",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis is an Open Redirect (CWE-601) vulnerability in the login flow of n8n. Authenticated users can be redirected to untrusted, attacker-controlled domains after logging in, by crafting malicious URLs with a misleading redirect query parameter.\n\nThis may lead to:\n\n- Phishing attacks by impersonating the n8n UI on lookalike domains (e.g., n8n.local.evil.com)\n- Credential or 2FA theft if users are tricked into re-entering sensitive information\n- Reputation risk due to the visual similarity between attacker-controlled domains and trusted ones\n\nThe vulnerability affects anyone hosting n8n and exposing the `/signin` endpoint to users.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in [1.98.0](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases/tag/n8n%401.98.0).\nAll users should upgrade to this version or later.\n\nThe fix introduces strict origin validation for redirect URLs, ensuring only same-origin or relative paths are allowed after login.\n\nPatch commit: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/16034",
