This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in the user's crate for Rust. This vulnerability allows privilege escalation via incorrect group listing when a user or process has fewer than exactly 1024 groups, leading to the erroneous inclusion of the root group in the access list.",
