  ],
  "summary": "@haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs Iframe Phishing vulnerability",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nIn the HAX site editor, users can create a website block to load another site in an iframe. The application allows users to supply a target URL in the website block. When the HAX site is visited, the client's browser will query the supplied URL.\n\n### Affected Resources\n\n- [Operations.php:868](https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-php/blob/master/system/backend/php/lib/Operations.php#L868)\n- `https://<site>/<user>/system/api/saveNode`\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Set the URL in an iframe pointing to an attacker-controlled server running Responder\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baac23ec-7b1e-49cf-864d-c3550b2c71bf)\n\n2. Once another user visits the site, they are prompted to sign in.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3a0b75d-e12f-49cf-8669-9686353a92e2)\n\n3. If a user inputs credentials, the username and password hash are outputted in Responder.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428542d3-8cf5-4bfa-b759-e630c3ee6ac3)\n\n### Impact\n\nAn authenticated attacker can create a HAX site with a website block pointing at an attacker-controlled server running Responder or a similar tool. The attacker can then conduct a phishing attack by convincing another user to visit their malicious HAX site to harvest credentials.",
