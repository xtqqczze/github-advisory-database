  "summary": "Jupyter Core on Windows Has Uncontrolled Search Path Element Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nOn Windows, the shared `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory is searched for configuration files (`SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` and `SYSTEM_JUPYTER_PATH`), which may allow users to create configuration files affecting other users.\n\nOnly shared Windows systems with multiple users and unprotected `%PROGRAMDATA%` are affected.\n\n## Mitigations\n\n- upgrade to `jupyter_core>=5.8.1` (5.8.0 is patched but breaks `jupyter-server`) , or\n- as administrator, modify the permissions on the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory so it is not writable by unauthorized users, or\n- as administrator, create the `%PROGRAMDATA%\\jupyter` directory with appropriately restrictive permissions, or\n- as user or administrator, set the `%PROGRAMDATA%` environment variable to a directory with appropriately restrictive permissions (e.g. controlled by administrators _or_ the current user)\n\n## Credit\n\nReported via Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative as ZDI-CAN-25932",
