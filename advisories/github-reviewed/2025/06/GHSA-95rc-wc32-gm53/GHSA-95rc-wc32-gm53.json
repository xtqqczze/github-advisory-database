  "summary": "Gokapi vulnerable to stored XSS via uploading file with malicious file name",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using end-to-end encryption, a stored XSS vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with JavaScript code embedded in the filename. After upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed.\n\nWith the affected versions <v2.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users with <v2.0. Nethertheless with XSS, other attack vectors like redirection or crypto mining would be possble.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis CVE has been fixed in v2.0.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are the only authenticated user using Gokapi, you are not affected. A workaround would be to disable end-to-end encryption.",
