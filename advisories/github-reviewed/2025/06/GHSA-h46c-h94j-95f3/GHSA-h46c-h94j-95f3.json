  "summary": "jackson-core can throw a StackoverflowError when processing deeply nested data",
  "details": "### Impact\nWith older versions  of jackson-core, if you parse an input file and it has deeply nested data, Jackson could end up throwing a StackoverflowError if the depth is particularly large.\n\n### Patches\njackson-core 2.15.0 contains a configurable limit for how deep Jackson will traverse in an input document, defaulting to an allowable depth of 1000. Change is in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/943. jackson-core will throw a StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached.\njackson-databind also benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON inputs.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers should avoid parsing input files from untrusted sources.",
