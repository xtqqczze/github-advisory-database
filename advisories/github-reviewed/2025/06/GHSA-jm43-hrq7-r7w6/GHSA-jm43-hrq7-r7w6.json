  "summary": "XWiki allows privilege escalation through link refactoring",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nPages can gain script or programming rights when they contain a link and the target of the link is renamed or moved. This might lead to execution of scripts contained in xobjects that should have never been executed. \nThis vulnerability affects all version of XWiki since 8.2 and 7.4.5.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch consists in only setting the `originalMetadataAuthor` when performing such change, so that it's displayed in the history but it has no impact on the right evaluation (i.e. the original author of the changes is still used for right computation). \n\nThis patch has been applied on XWiki 16.4.7, 17.1.0RC1, 16.10.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this vulnerability, except preventing to perform any refactoring operation with users having more than edit rights. \nAdministrators are strongly advised to upgrade. If not possible, the patch only impacts module `xwiki-platform-refactoring-default` so it's possible to apply the commit and rebuild and deploy only that module.\n\n### CVSS explanation\n\nAttack vector: Network - Always for XWiki.\nComplexity: Low - The set of operations to perform the attack is quite easy.\nAttack requirements: None - Any system is vulnerable, it doesn't depend on specific condition other than user interaction.\nPrivileges required: Low - The attacker only needs edit rights.\nUser interaction: Active - To be successful the attack needs someone with more rights to perform a move/rename of a specific page.\nConfidentiality: High - The attack might lead to execution of any script.\nIntegrity: High - The attack might lead to execution of any script.\nAvailability: High - The attack might lead to execution of any script.\nSubsequent system impacts: None for any criteria. Only current system is affected.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)",
