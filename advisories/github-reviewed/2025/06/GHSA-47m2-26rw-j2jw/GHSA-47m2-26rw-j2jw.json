This is very similar to the previous security issue CVE-2022-44571.\n\n### Details\n\nCarefully crafted input can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipart parsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to [scyoon](https://hackerone.com/scyoon) for reporting this to the Rails security team",
