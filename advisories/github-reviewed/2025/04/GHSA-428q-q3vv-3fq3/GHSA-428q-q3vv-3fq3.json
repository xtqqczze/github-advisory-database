  "summary": "GraphQL grant on a property might be cached with different objects",
  "details": "### Original message:\n\nI found an issue with security grants on on properties in the GraphQL ItemNormalizer:\n\nIf you use something like `#[ApiProperty(security: 'is_granted(\"PROPERTY_READ\", [object, property])')]` on a member of an entity, the grant gets cached and is only evaluated once, even if the `object` in question is a different one.\n\nThere is the `ApiPlatform\\GraphQl\\Serializer\\ItemNormalizer::isCacheKeySafe()` method that seems to be intended to prevent this: https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/88f5ac50d20d6510686a7552310cc567fcca45bf/src/GraphQl/Serializer/ItemNormalizer.php#L160-L164  \nand in its usage on line 90 it does indeed not create a cache key, but the `parent::normalize()` that is called afterwards still creates the cache key and causes the issue.\n\n### Impact\n\nIt grants access to properties that it should not.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOverride the ItemNormalizer.\n\nPatched at: https://github.com/api-platform/core/commit/7af65aad13037d7649348ee3dcd88e084ef771f8",
