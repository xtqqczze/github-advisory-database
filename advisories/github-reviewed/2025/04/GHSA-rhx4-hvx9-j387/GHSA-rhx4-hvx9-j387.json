  "summary": "Silverstripe Framework has a XSS vulnerability in HTML editor",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could send a specifically crafted encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The payload would be sanitised on the client-side, but server-side sanitisation doesn't catch it.\n\nThe server-side sanitisation logic has been updated to sanitise against this attack.\n\n### Reported by\n\nJames Nicoll from Fujitsu Cyber\n\n### References\n\n- https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2025-30148",
