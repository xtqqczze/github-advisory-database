  "summary": "Yeswiki Vulnerable to Authenticated Reflected Cross-site Scripting",
  "details": "### Summary\n**Vulnerable Version:** Yeswiki < v4.5.4\n**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/?PagePrincipale%2Fdeletepage`\n**Vulnerable Parameter:** `incomingurl`\n**Payload:** `\"><script>alert(1)</script>`\n\n### Details\nReflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.\n\n### PoC\n**NOTE:** This vulnerability requires admin access.\n1. Visit the endpoint as mentioned below and see that an alert box pops up:\n\n   **URL with Payload:** `https://yeswiki.net/?PagePrincipale%2Fdeletepage&incomingurl=\"><script>alert(1)</script>`\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can use a reflected cross-site scripting attack to steal cookies from an authenticated user by having them click on a malicious link. Stolen cookies allow the attacker to take over the userâ€™s session. This vulnerability may also allow attackers to deface the website or embed malicious content.",
