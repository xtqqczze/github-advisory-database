  "summary": "@clerk/backend Performs Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nApplications that use the `verifyWebhook()` helper to verify incoming Clerk webhooks are susceptible to accepting improperly signed webhook events.\n\n### Patches\n\n* `@clerk/backend`: the helper has been patched as of `2.4.0`\n* `@clerk/astro`: the helper has been patched as of `2.10.2`\n* `@clerk/express`: the helper has been patched as of `1.7.4`\n* `@clerk/fastify`: the helper has been patched as of `2.4.4`\n* `@clerk/nextjs`: the helper has been patched as of `6.23.3`\n* `@clerk/nuxt`: the helper has been patched as of `1.7.5`\n* `@clerk/react-router`: the helper has been patched as of `1.6.4`\n* `@clerk/remix`: the helper has been patched as of `4.8.5`\n* `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`: the helper has been patched as of `0.18.3`\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe issue was resolved in **`@clerk/backend` `2.4.0`** by:\n\n* Properly parsing the webhook request's signatures and comparing them against the signature generated from the received event\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf unable to upgrade, developers can workaround this issue by verifying webhooks manually, per [this documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/overview#protect-your-webhooks-from-abuse).",
