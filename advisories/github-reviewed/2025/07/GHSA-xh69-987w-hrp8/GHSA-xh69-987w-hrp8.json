  "summary": "resolv vulnerable to DoS via insufficient DNS domain name length validation",
  "details": "A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the resolv gem bundled with Ruby.\n\n## Details\nThe vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting\nlength of the name.\n\nThis resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.\n\n## Affected Version\nThe vulnerability affects the resolv gem bundled with the following Ruby series:\n* Ruby 3.2 series: resolv version 0.2.2 and earlier\n* Ruby 3.3 series: resolv version 0.3.0\n* Ruby 3.4 series: resolv version 0.6.1 and earlier\n\n## Credits\nThanks to Manu for discovering this issue.\n\n## History\nOriginally published at 2025-07-08 07:00:00 (UTC)",
