  "summary": "tarteaucitron.js vulnerable to DOM Clobbering via document.currentScript",
  "details": "A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual `<script>` element. If an attacker injected an HTML element such as:\n\n```\n<img name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https://malicious.example.com\">\n```\n\nit could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an <img> element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly.\n\nThis issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements (e.g., name=\"currentScript\") become properties on the global document object.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron.\n\n## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/230a3b69d363837acfa895823d841e0608826ba3\nThe issue was resolved by verifying that document.currentScript is an instance of HTMLScriptElement. If not, the script now falls back safely to the last <script> tag on the page.",
