  "details": "### Impact\nA specially crafted GIF file containing a malformed comment extension block (with a missing block terminator) can cause the ImageSharp GIF decoder to enter an infinite loop while attempting to skip the block. This leads to a denial of service. Applications processing untrusted GIF input should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched. All users are advised to upgrade to v3.1.11 or v2.1.11.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.",
