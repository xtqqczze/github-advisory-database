  "summary": "LlamaIndex has an XML Entity Expansion vulnerability in its sitemap parser",
  "details": "An XML Entity Expansion vulnerability, also known as a 'billion laughs' attack, exists in the sitemap parser of the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically affecting the Papers Loaders package before version 0.3.2 (in llama-index v0.10.0 and above through v0.12.29). This vulnerability allows an attacker to supply a malicious Sitemap XML, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting system memory and potentially causing a system crash. The issue is resolved in version 0.3.2 (in llama-index 0.12.29).",
