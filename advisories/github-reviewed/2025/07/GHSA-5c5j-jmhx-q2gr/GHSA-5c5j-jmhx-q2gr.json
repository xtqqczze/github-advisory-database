This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nThe gix-transport crate before 0.36.1 for Rust allows command execution via the \"gix clone 'ssh://-oProxyCommand=open$IFS\" substring. NOTE: this was discovered before CVE-2024-32884, a similar vulnerability (involving a username field) that is more difficult to exploit.",
