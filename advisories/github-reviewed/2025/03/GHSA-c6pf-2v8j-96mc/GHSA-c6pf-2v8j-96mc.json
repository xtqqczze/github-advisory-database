  "summary": "Cilium node based network policies may incorrectly allow workload traffic",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n[Node based network policies](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#node-based) (`fromNodes` and `toNodes`) will incorrectly permit traffic to/from non-node endpoints that share the labels specified in `fromNodes` and `toNodes` sections of network policies. Node based network policy is disabled by default in Cilium.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was fixed by https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/36657.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n- Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive\n\nThis issue is fixed in:\n\n- Cilium v1.16.8\n- Cilium v1.17.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers can work around this issue by ensuring that the labels used in `fromNodes` and `toNodes` fields are used exclusively by nodes and not by other endpoints.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @oblazek  for reporting and fixing this issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.
