  "summary": "Directus's S3 assets become unavailable after a burst of HEAD requests",
  "details": "### Summary\nThere's some tools that use Directus to sync content and assets.\nSome of those tools use HEAD method, like Shopify, to check the existence of files.\nAlthough, when making many HEAD requests at once, at some point, all assets are being served as 403.\n\n### Details\nWhen I was investigating this issue, I have found that after the burst of HEAD requests, the amount of `sockets` held on [Agent on NodeHttpHandler](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-typescript/blob/main/packages/node-http-handler/src/node-http-handler.ts#L189) was always equal to [`STORAGE_CLOUD_MAX_SOCKETS`](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/packages/storage-driver-s3/src/index.ts#L89) making it impossible to have new connections causing assets to be inaccessible.\n\nAfter looking into this [issue on AWS SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/6691) I found that if the [stream is requested](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/services/assets.ts#L213), it needs to be consumed otherwise will hang forever. And as can be [seen here](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/controllers/assets.ts#L233-L238) the stream is not consumed.\n\nThe [timeouts set here](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/packages/storage-driver-s3/src/index.ts#L87-L88)  had no noticeable effect on tests made.\n\n### PoC\nThis can be easily reproduced with the following steps:\n- setup AWS S3 storage\n- set STORAGE_CLOUD_MAX_SOCKETS: \"50\" (this value is lower than default for easier reproduction)\n- upload a file to your project\n- run this file (Replace the the file ID with the one you just uploaded):\n```ts\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nasync function start() {\n  Array.from({ length: 400 }, (_, i) => {\n    axios\n      .head(\n        \"http://localhost:8055/assets/e536aa35-3a81-4fa9-b856-3780584d38d8\"\n      )\n      .then(() => console.log(\"✅\"))\n      .catch((e) =>\n        console.log(\"⛔\", e.response?.status || e.code || e.message)\n      );\n  });\n}\n\nstart();\n```\n\nHere's an example:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d65bf0-5637-478f-a215-083c2ded3753\n\n\n\n\n### Impact\nThis causes denial of assets for all policies of Directus, including Admin and Public.",
