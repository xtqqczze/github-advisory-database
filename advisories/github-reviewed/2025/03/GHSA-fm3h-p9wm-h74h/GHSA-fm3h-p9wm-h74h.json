  "summary": "Directus's webhook trigger flows can leak sensitive data",
  "details": "### Describe the Bug\n\n In Directus, when a **Flow** with the \"_Webhook_\" trigger and the \"_Data of Last Operation_\" response body encounters a ValidationError thrown by a failed condition operation, the API response includes sensitive data. This includes environmental variables, sensitive API keys, user accountability information, and operational data.\n\nThis issue poses a significant security risk, as any unintended exposure of this data could lead to potential misuse.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb894347-cd10-4e79-9469-8fc1b2289794)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a20337a2-005f-4cfd-ba30-fc5f579ed6c4)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b776248-4a20-46f0-92a4-3760d8e53df9)\n\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Create a Flow in Directus with:\n   - Trigger: Webhook\n   - Response Body: Data of Last Operation\n2. Add a condition that is likely to fail.\n3. Trigger the Flow with any input data that will fail the condition.\n4. Observe the API response, which includes sensitive information like:\n   - Environmental variables (`$env`)\n   - Authorization headers\n   - User details under `$accountability`\n   - Previous operational data.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nIn the event of a ValidationError, the API response should only contain relevant error messages and details, avoiding the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nThe API response includes sensitive information such as:\n- Environment keys (`FLOWS_ENV_ALLOW_LIST`)\n- User accountability (`role`, `user`, etc.)\n- Operational logs (`current_payments`, `$last`), which might contain private details.",
