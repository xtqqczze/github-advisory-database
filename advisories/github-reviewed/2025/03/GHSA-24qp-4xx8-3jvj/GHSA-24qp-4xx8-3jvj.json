  ],
  "summary": "Cilium East-west traffic not subject to egress policy enforcement for requests via Gateway API load balancers",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nFor Cilium users who:\n- Use Gateway API for Ingress for some services **AND**\n- Use [LB-IPAM](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam/) or BGP for LB Service implementation **AND**\n- Use network policies to block egress traffic from workloads in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces\n\nEgress traffic from workloads covered by such network policies to LoadBalancers configured by `Gateway` resources will incorrectly be allowed.\n\nLoadBalancer resources not deployed via a Gateway API configuration are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was fixed by https://github.com/cilium/proxy/pull/1172.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.14 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive\n\nThis issue is fixed in:\n\n- Cilium v1.15.15\n- Cilium v1.16.8\n- Cilium v1.17.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy can be used to work around this issue for users who are unable to upgrade. An outline of such a policy is provided below:\n\n```\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: \"workaround\"\nspec:\n  endpointSelector:\n    matchExpressions:\n    - key: reserved:ingress\n      operator: Exists\n  ingress:\n  - fromEntities:\n    - world\n```\n\n- The policy opens up connectivity from all locations outside the cluster into the Cilium Ingress Gateway.\n- The policy establishes a default deny for all other traffic towards the Cilium Ingress Gateway, including all in-cluster sources.\n- It is possible to tailor the policy to more narrowly allow inbound traffic while creating a default deny posture for traffic between namespaces. Users should edit the policy to bring it in line with the security requirements particular to their environments.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of the Isovalent team to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @jrajahalme for the fix.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.",
