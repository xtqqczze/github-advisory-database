  ],
  "summary": "Soft Serve vulnerable to path traversal attacks",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nPath traversal attack gives access to existing non-admin users to access and take over other user's repositories. A malicious user then can modify, delete, and arbitrarily repositories as if they were an admin user without explicitly giving them permissions.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in [v0.8.2](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.8.2)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSingle user set-ups are not affected. This only affects multi-user Soft Serve set-ups that enable repository creation for users. Otherwise, upgrading is necessary to circumvent the attack.\n\n\n",
