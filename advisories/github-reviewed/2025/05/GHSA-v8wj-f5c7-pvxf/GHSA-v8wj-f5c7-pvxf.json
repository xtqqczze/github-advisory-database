  "summary": "Strapi allows Server-Side Request Forgery in Webhook function",
  "details": "## Description\nIn Strapi latest version, at function Settings -> Webhooks, the application allows us to input a URL in order to create a Webook connection. However, we can input into this field the local domains such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`,.... in order to make the Application fetching into the internal itself, which causes the vulnerability `Server - Side Request Forgery (SSRF)`.\n\n\n## Payloads\n- `http://127.0.0.1:80` -> `The Port is not open`\n- `http://127.0.0.1:1337` -> `The Port which Strapi is running on`\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n- First of all, let's input the URL `http://127.0.0.1:80` into the `URL` field, and click \"Save\".\n\n\n![CleanShot 2024-06-04 at 22 45 17@2x](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/assets/71650574/7336b817-cb61-41e6-9b3f-87151d8667e9)\n\n\n- Next, use the \"Trigger\" function and use Burp Suite to capture the request / response\n\n\n![CleanShot 2024-06-04 at 22 47 50@2x](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/assets/71650574/659f1bbe-6b03-456c-a9c2-5187fca20dd6)\n\n\n- The server return `request to http://127.0.0.1/ failed, reason: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:80`, BECAUSE the `Port 80` is not open, since we are running Strapi on `Port 1337`, let's change the URL we input above into `http://127.0.0.1:1337`\n\n\n![CleanShot 2024-06-04 at 22 50 13@2x](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/assets/71650574/a7916c86-1923-49ed-bd43-a70fa00d41e9)\n\n\n- Continue to click the \"Trigger\" function, use Burp to capture the request / response\n\n\n![CleanShot 2024-06-04 at 22 53 25@2x](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/assets/71650574/6fc51bb7-5a66-4b2b-b24f-2eba45ba1db9)\n\n\n- The server returns `Method Not Allowed`, which means that there actually is a `Port 1337` running the machine.\n\n\n## PoC\nHere is the Poc Video, please check: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvVp9lMpYnGLmUyr16gQ_2RetI-GqYjV/view?usp=sharing\n\n## Impact\n\n- If there is a real server running Strapi with many ports open, by using this SSRF vulnerability, the attacker can brute-force through all 65535 ports to know what ports are open.",
