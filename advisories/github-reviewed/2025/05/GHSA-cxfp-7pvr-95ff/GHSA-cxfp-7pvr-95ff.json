  "summary": "containerd CRI plugin: Incorrect cgroup hierarchy assignment for containers running in usernamespaced Kubernetes pods.",
  "details": "# Impact\n\nA bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where containerd doesn't put usernamespaced containers under the Kubernetes' cgroup hierarchy, therefore some Kubernetes limits are not honored. This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node.\n\n# Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nDisable usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.\n\n# Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank Rodrigo Campos Catelin and Piotr Rogowski for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n#  For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at security@containerd.io\n\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)",
