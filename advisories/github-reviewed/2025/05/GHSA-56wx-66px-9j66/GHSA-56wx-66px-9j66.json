As OPKSSH depends on the OpenPubkey library for authentication, this vulnerability in OpenPubkey also applies to OPKSSH versions prior to 0.5.0 and would allow an attacker to bypass OPKSSH authentication.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability does not exist in more recent versions of OPKSSH. his only impacts OPKSSH  when used to verify ssh keys on a server, the OPKSSH client is unaffected. To remediate upgrade to a version of OPKSSH v0.5.0 or greater.\n\nTo determine if you are vulnerable run on your server:\n\n```bash\nopkssh --version\n```\n\nIf the version is less than 0.5.0 you should upgrade. To upgrade to the latest version run:\n\n```bash\nwget -qO- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openpubkey/opkssh/main/scripts/install-linux.sh\" | sudo bash\n``` \n\n\n### References\n\n[CVE-2025-4658](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4658)\n\nThe upstream vulnerability in OpenPubkey is [CVE-2025-3757](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3757) and has the security advisory https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/security/advisories/GHSA-537f-gxgm-3jjq",
