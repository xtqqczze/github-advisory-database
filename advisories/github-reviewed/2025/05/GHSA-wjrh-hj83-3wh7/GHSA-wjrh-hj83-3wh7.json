  "summary": "Django-Select2 Vulnerable to Widget Instance Secret Cache Key Leaking",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nInstances of `HeavySelect2Mixin` subclasses like the `ModelSelect2MultipleWidget` and `ModelSelect2Widget` can secret access tokens across requests. This can allow users to access restricted querysets and restricted data.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 8.4.1 and all following versions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis vulnerability is limited use cases where instances of widget classes are created during app loading (not during a request).\n\nExample of affected code:\n```python\nclass MyForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        widgets = {\"my_select_field\": Select2ModelWidget()}\n```\n\nDjango allows you to pass just the widget class (not the instance). This can be used to mitigate the session request leak.\n\nExample of affected code:\n```python\nclass MyForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        widgets = {\"my_select_field\": Select2ModelWidget}\n```\n\n\n\n### References\n\nThanks to @neartik for reporting this issue. I will address it later. I had to delete your issue, to avoid exploitation of this security issue.",
