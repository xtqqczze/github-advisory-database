When running a Next.js server locally (e.g. through `npm run dev`), the WebSocket server is vulnerable to the Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH) attack. and a bad actor can access the source code of client components, if a user was to visit a malicious link while having the Next.js dev server running.\n\n### Impact\nIf a user is running a Next.js server locally (e.g. `npm run dev`), and they were to browse to a malicious website, the malicious website may be able to access the source code of the Next.js app. This vulnerability only affects applications making use of App Router.\n\n_Note: App Router was experimental requiring_ `experimental.appDir = true` _in versions_ `>=13.0.0` to  `<13.4`.",
