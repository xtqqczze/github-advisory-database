  "summary": "Fess has Insecure Temporary File Permissions",
  "details": "### Summary\nFess (an open-source Enterprise Search Server) creates temporary files without restrictive permissions, which may allow local attackers to read sensitive information from these temporary files.\n\n### Details\nThe `createTempFile()` method in `org.codelibs.fess.helper.SystemHelper` creates temporary files without explicitly setting restrictive permissions. This could lead to potential information disclosure, allowing unauthorized local users to access sensitive data contained in these files.\n\n### Impact\nThis issue primarily affects environments where Fess is deployed in a shared or multi-user context. Typical single-user or isolated deployments have minimal or negligible practical impact.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure local access to the environment running Fess is restricted to trusted users only.\n\n### References\n- [CVE-2022-24823: Netty temporary file permissions vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24823)",
