  "summary": "league/commonmark contains a XSS vulnerability in Attributes extension",
  "details": "### Summary\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the [Attributes extension](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/extensions/attributes/) of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML.\n\n### Details\n\nThe league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces.\n\nAs a result, even with the secure configuration shown above, an attacker can inject dangerous attributes into applications using this extension via a payload such as:\n\n```md\n![](){onerror=alert(1)}\n```\n\nWhich results in the following HTML:\n\n```html\n<p><img onerror=\"alert(1)\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n```\n\nWhich causes the JS to execute immediately on page load.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector:\n\n- All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default\n- [Support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.7/extensions/attributes/#configuration)\n- Manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not feasible, please consider:\n\n- Disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users\n- [Filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/#additional-filtering)",
