  "details": "### Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-93c7-7xqw-w357. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nPingora versions prior to 0.5.0 which used the caching functionality in pingora-proxy did not properly drain the downstream request body on cache hits.\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft malicious HTTP/1.1 requests which could lead to request smuggling or cache poisoning.\n\nThis flaw was corrected in commit fda3317ec822678564d641e7cf1c9b77ee3759ff by ensuring that the downstream request body is always drained before a connection can be reused.\n\nSee [the blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/resolving-a-request-smuggling-vulnerability-in-pingora/) for more information.",
