  "summary": "October CMS Allows Unprotected SVG Rename in Media Manager",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis advisory affects authenticated administrators with sites that have the `media.clean_vectors` configuration enabled. This configuration will sanitize SVG files uploaded using the media manager. This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass this protection by uploading it with a permitted extension (for example, .jpg or .png) and later modifying it to the .svg extension.\n\nThis vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v3.7.5.\n\n### References\n\nCredits to:\n- [Cyber-Wo0dy](https://github.com/Cyber-Wo0dy)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)",
