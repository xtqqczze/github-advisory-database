  "summary": "TinyScientist has Path Traversal Vulnerability in PDF Review Function (CWE-22)",
  "details": "## Description\nA critical path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) has been identified in the `review_paper` function in `backend/app.py`. The vulnerability allows malicious users to access arbitrary PDF files on the server by providing crafted file paths that bypass the intended security restrictions.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to:\n- Read any PDF file accessible to the server process\n- Potentially access sensitive documents outside the intended directory\n- Perform reconnaissance on the server's file system structure\n\n## Vulnerable Code\nThe issue occurs in the `review_paper` function around line 744:\n\n```python\nif pdf_path.startswith(\"/api/files/\"):\n    # Safe path handling for API routes\n    relative_path = pdf_path[len(\"/api/files/\"):]\n    generated_base = os.path.join(project_root, \"generated\")\n    absolute_pdf_path = os.path.join(generated_base, relative_path)\nelse:\n    absolute_pdf_path = pdf_path  # VULNERABLE: Direct use of user input\n```\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/review \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"pdf_path\": \"/etc/passwd\"}'\n```\n\n## Credit\nThis vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ruizhe.",
