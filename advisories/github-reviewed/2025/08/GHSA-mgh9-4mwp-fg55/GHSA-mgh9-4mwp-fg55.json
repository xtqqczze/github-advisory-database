  "summary": "OpenFGA Authorization Bypass ",
  "details": "### Overview\nOpenFGA v1.9.3 to v1.9.4 ( openfga-0.2.40 <= Helm chart <= openfga-0.2.41, v1.9.3 <= docker <= v.1.9.4) are vulnerable to improper policy enforcement when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.\n\n### Am I Affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using OpenFGA v1.9.3 to v1.9.4, specifically under the following preconditions:\n- Calling Check API or ListObjects with an [authorization model](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-an-authorization-model) that has a relationship directly assignable by more than 1 [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets) with same [type](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-a-type), and\n- There are check or list object queries that rely on the above relationship, and\n- You have userset tuples that are assigned to the above relationship\n\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade to v1.9.5. This upgrade is backwards compatible.\n\n### Workaround\nDowngrade to v1.9.2 with enable-check-optimizations removed from OPENFGA_EXPERIMENTALS\n\n### Acknowledgments\nOpenFGA would like Dominic Harries and rrozza-apolitical to thank for discovering this vulnerability.",
