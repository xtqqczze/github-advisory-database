  ],
  "summary": "Claude Code's Permissive Default Allowlist Enables Unauthorized File Read and Network Exfiltration in Claude Code",
  "details": "Due to an overly broad allowlist of safe commands, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompts to read a file and then send file contents over the network without user confirmation. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release. Current users of Claude Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced to update.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/wunderwuzzi23 for reporting this issue!",
