  "summary": "screenshot-desktop vulnerable to command Injection via `format` option",
  "details": "## Impact\nThis vulnerability is a **command injection** issue.  \nWhen user-controlled input is passed into the `format` option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization.  \nAn attacker can craft malicious input such as:\n\n    { format: \"; echo vulnerable > /tmp/hello;\" }\n\nThis results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process.\n\n**Who is impacted:**  \nAny application that accepts untrusted input and forwards it directly (or indirectly) into the `format` option is affected. If the library is used in a server-side context (e.g., API endpoints, web services), attackers may be able to exploit this **remotely and without authentication**, leading to full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  \n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n\n## Patches\nThe issue has been patched in **version 1.15.2**.  \nAll users are strongly recommended to upgrade to **1.15.2 or later**.  \nAll earlier versions are vulnerable.\n\n\n\n## Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, developers should:\n- **Strictly validate or whitelist** acceptable `format` values (e.g., `\"jpeg\"`, `\"png\"`, `\"webp\"`).\n- **Reject or sanitize** any unexpected input before passing it to the library.\n- Avoid allowing user-controlled data to reach the `format` option.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [CWE-78: OS Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)  \n- [OWASP: Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)",
