  "summary": "Valtimo scripting engine can be used to gain access to sensitive data or resources",
  "details": "### Impact\nAny admin that can create or modify and execute process-definitions could gain access to sensitive data or resources.\n\nThis includes but is not limited to:\n- Running executables on the application host\n- Inspecting and extracting data from the host environment or application properties\n- Spring beans (application context, database pooling)\n\n### Attack requirements\nThe following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack:\n- The user must be logged in\n- The user must have the admin role (ROLE_ADMIN), which is required to change process definitions\n- The user must have some knowledge about running scripts via a the Camunda/Operator engine\n\n### Patches\nVersion 12.16.0 and 13.1.2 have been patched. It is strongly advised to upgrade.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf no scripting is needed in any of the processes, it could be possible to disable it altogether via the `ProcessEngineConfiguration`:\n```\n@Component\nclass NoScriptEnginePlugin : ProcessEnginePlugin {\n    override fun preInit(processEngineConfiguration: ProcessEngineConfigurationImpl) {}\n\n    override fun postInit(processEngineConfiguration: ProcessEngineConfigurationImpl) {\n        processEngineConfiguration.scriptEngineResolver = null\n    }\n\n    override fun postProcessEngineBuild(processEngine: ProcessEngine) {}\n}\n```\nWarning: this workaround could lead to unexpected side-effects. Please test thoroughly.\n\n### References\n- Valtimo 12 and lower: [Camunda Scripting](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/scripting/#custom-scriptengineresolver)\n- Valtimo 13 and higher: [Operaton Scripting](https://docs.operaton.org/docs/documentation/user-guide/process-engine/scripting)",
